# PanelSwiper
The PanelSwiper C# script can be used to swipe between different panels (or other GameObjects) within the Unity UI.

There is an example Unity Scene to showcase the functionality. Depending on the screen size or orientation, 
the panels would need to be resized and repositioned.
The script is currently programmed in a way that swiping on the leftmost and rightmost panel is disabled.
